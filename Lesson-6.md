* Students will be building a website, WP Workout, this will be a workout/exercise company website. Students will need to research Workout websites. What are typical pages on a site? Would those pages be better as a WordPress page or a WordPress post?
* Students will begin developing the content for their website. The student will need to compose at least three posts for the blog portion of the site. All posts need to include links to helpful resources and images. The student needs to schedule those posts to be posted once a week for the next three weeks.
* The students will need to determine what pages will be on the website. They should begin populating the site with the content by creating the pages.
* WordPress WP Workout: Publish a post on your WordPress class blog identifying the workout websites you used as a reference. What information did you decide to have on your site. Make sure to identify whether that information is set up as a post or a page. In your post, also reflect back to the first week of the course where you learned HTML/CSS? Discuss the time it would have taking you to code these page in straight HTML/CSS vs. using WordPress.
